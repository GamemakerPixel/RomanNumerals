# Roman Numeral Kata
Author: Aidan Bensch
## Description
A class that converts integers in the range [1, 3000] into roman numeral representations.
## Testing Instructions
Run the tests in src/test
## Additional Notes
This class assumes that integers passed into it meet the preconditions.
There are a number of tests in RomanNumeralTest that have duplicate logic, but this is done intentionally so that the seperate concepts they are testing is clear.
